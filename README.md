# VisIt

A work-in-progress addon for Blender that speeds up the process of creating previsualisation (a.k.a previs or previz).

## Disclaimer

As a work-in-progress, the addon is not ready for any production use. Nothing is guaranteed to be working properly, and the code will be changing a lot. Additionally, the documentation is incomplete.

If you still would like to play and test the implemented functions of the addon, feel free to do so. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.
